Graduation Thesis Work

In recent years, dementia, which has become more common among the elderly, is one of the neurodegenerative diseases that gradually reduce the patient's quality of life. Most cases of dementia are caused by Alzheimer's disease, which is primarily diagnosed using imaging methods such as MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). This research investigates the use of DL (Deep Learning) models to accelerate and facilitate the diagnosis process of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Dementia and Alzheimer's. The aim is to examine the accuracy of different DL algorithms and achieve a success rate superior to the accuracy rates reported in the literature. The introduction of the study outlines the existing classification models, highlights the advantages of MRI guidance, and emphasizes the need for improved early diagnosis using AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based methods. DL models are used to enable early diagnosis. The literature review explores the potential of DL models in increasing the success rate of early diagnosis. The results follow models such as DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, DenseNet-201, MobileNet, VGG16, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of DL models in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases using MRI data. The ... model(s) show promising results with an accuracy rate of %..%.

In addition to the study, another MRI technique, DTI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging), was used to obtain FA (Fractional Anisotropy) images, and image enhancement techniques were applied to further investigate Alzheimer's disease and develop related studies. These steps were taken to assist in the training and detection processes in the deep learning stages using the enhanced FA images. The findings in this study aim to assist medical professionals in the early diagnosis of Dementia and Alzheimer's disease
